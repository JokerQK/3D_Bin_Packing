# 3D_Bin_Packing
An NP-hard Algorithm Problem: 3D Bin Packing
1. Design concept
- Define three kind of objects: container, pallet and box.
- Pack a already known 2D bin packing problem to an API.
2. Design algorithm
- Store box object in a queue.
- Boxes in layer 1 will be placed on physical pallet, others will be placed on virtual pallet.
- Objects will be processed by BFS order, boxes will be decided by greedy algorithm.

- To be update......
